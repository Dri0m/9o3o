This is a website that loads a random game from [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/) into the browser using [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle). It also replicates the URL spoofing capabilities of Flashpoint using a system based on TBubba's [Ruffle Redirect](https://github.com/TBubba/ruffle-redirect-poc) proof-of-concept.

While the site currently has little functionality, the end goal is to essentially turn it into an online version of the Flashpoint archive.
