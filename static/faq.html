        <h2>What's 9o3o?</h2>
            9o3o is an official (but experimental) online version of the <a href="https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/">Flashpoint Archive</a>.
        <h2>Why are only some games available on 9o3o?</h2>
            9o3o is a small experiment which currently only supports flash games via Ruffle emulator. Ruffle is not yet finished and doesn't support all games. Some games also simply does not run in the browser without additional hacks and tricks, which are implemented in Flashpoint but not in 9o3o.
