        <div class="question">What's 9o3o?</div>
        <a href="/">9o3o</a> is an official (but experimental) online version of the <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/">Flashpoint Archive</a>. It also serves as a test bed for the <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> and <a href="https://create3000.github.io/x_ite/">X_ITE</a> emulators. Both the backend and frontend are open-source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/Dri0m/9o3o">here</a>.
        <div class="question">Why are only some entries available on 9o3o?</div>
        9o3o makes use of open-source emulators for platforms supported by Flashpoint, of which there aren't many.
        <div class="question">An entry isn't working!</div>
        The emulators 9o3o utilizes are still in development and not everything will run properly as a result. If you want to increase the chance that an entry will start working in the future, open an issue in the respective emulator's GitHub repository.
